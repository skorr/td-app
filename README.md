[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/skorr/testdriven-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/skorr/testdriven-app)

    Be sure to replace skorr with your actual GitHub username.

In terms of workflow, for now, while the project structure is still somewhat simple, we'll:

    Code a new feature locally
    Commit and push code
    Ensure tests pass on Travis
